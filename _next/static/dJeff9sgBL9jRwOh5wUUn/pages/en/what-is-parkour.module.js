The natural method is also inspired by the lifestyle of the indigenous Africans and other parts of the world, who generally maintain a very good physical condition living in a natural environment.</1><2>So we see that the roots of parkour enter the most primitive lifestyle of the human being, something little surprising if we consider that doing parkour basically consists of \\"doing the monkey\\" to the city.</2>","parkour-vs-freerunning-title":"Parkour or freerunning? What is the difference?","parkour-vs-freerunning-description":"<0>Parkour, apart from being a physical discipline, has a philosophy behind it. There are famous phrases within the world of parkour such as etre et durer (being and lasting in French) or etre fort pour etre util (to be strong to be useful), which are illustrative of values \u200b\u200bsuch as: cooperation, non-competitiveness, self-improvement... that are implicit in parkour. Another important part of parkour\'s philosophy is to seek efficiency in the movement, in order to move from one place to another. We see that parkour has a practical point of view.</0><1>This is not the case in freerunning, a discipline that also consists of training mobility and displacement using only the body itself, but which has a freer view. What is sought in freerunning is creativity in movement, originality, and does not have a marked philosophy behind as parkour. Created by Sebstien Foucan, a training partner of David Belle, who spread parallel to this his own style of movement to England.</1><2>We see that parkour and freerunning are two schools of body movement in urban (or natural) environments with common origins, but different points of view result in two different styles. To get an idea, freerunning includes many more stunts, turns and pirouettes, but also includes many movements that are used in parkour.</2>"}')}},[["elll",0,1,2]]]);
